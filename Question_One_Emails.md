You are a part of a diverse team of hardware engineers, firmware software engineering, UI & backend engineers and a team of data scientists. Your team is working on an exciting new category-defining product that has tremendous market traction and the product is a hardware device with a software platform built on top of it. The product pulls from a variety of technical disciplines from firmware, frontend, backend, VoIP, Networking, mobile apps, web apps, IoT and machine learning.  

Your stakeholders are the founders of the company who have several years of experience building and selling technology companies. However, they are not completely familiar with all the new technologies that your team is working on. While the team has made several strides and has created a demo able product, the team is behind schedule by over 22 months due to various reasons. The mood of the overall team is still upbeat from having won an innovation award but is under stress to deliver a production-ready product in the next 90-days. 

**Q.1. Write an email to your team with your recommended approach to work with the various team members to ensure we are able to deliver a working product in 90-days?**

Subject: This sucks … nothing works on JIRA ticket MTS-1990
Message:

Here you go again. This ticket is marked ‘Ready for test’. But nothing works as it is supposed to. Do you have anyone who knows what they are doing? I cannot be wasting my time doing the testing for you. Have you heard of ‘testing’? My test results are documented on the ticket. Please review them and send me a version that works, in the next two days.

Thanks
Allan
