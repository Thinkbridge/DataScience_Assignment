Atlantis motor works is a large manufacturing firm engaged in making cars that use biologically derived carbon-hydrogen molecules to power the mobility of today. As a large multinational corporation, the financial team of Atlantis validates and checks thousands of bills and classifies them according to the different bill categories. You as a data scientist are tasked with automating this process. The Bills have been summarized into rows and the category labels are provided in the last column. This will form your dataset and you will be required building a model that can generate the predictions when a new row is presented. Column F represents the label you will be predicting.

Requirements:

Analyze, study the data and come up with a machine learning model and document why you chose the machine learning model.
The solution will need to handle never before seen categories in any of the feature columns Bonus points:
Your model needs to be production deployable and hosted in the cloud. Come up with an architecture diagram on how to deploy your model. The data will be sent to you as an API post request. Include the different cloud services that need to be in place and how it connects with one another. Preference for Azure services
How would you plan for a feedback or re-training the model? Your predictions will be human verified and a separate API will return the updated training data What do you need to submit?
1. A document summarizing the accuracy score of all the machine learning algorithms / feature engineering combination, add your detailed comments on why you choose your model
2. The Python code for generating the machine learning model submitted via a public GitHub repository. Instructions on how to run the code should be present, along with a requirements.txt file. Note: File must be in .py format. Jupiter Notebooks/Google Collabs will not be accepted as a valid submission.
3. Architecture Diagrams for the bonus questions in a separate word document

Evaluation:

- You are free to ask any questions for clarity or help
- Code readability and simplicity
- Coverage of all requirements
- Documentation and explanation of how you arrived at the chosen model
